# Parkzo

An IOT project that takes care of the Parking system in any mall. 

__Note: This is not a UI intensive app, but functionality intensive app!__

## Basic Idea
---
- Green Spots on the app suggest available slots, whenever a user books that spot it is marked blue on the Firebase and accordingly on the app.
- Once a car comes to the respective slot, the Ultrasonic sensor senses the car (with the reduced change in distance) and accordingly that spot it now taken and it shown red!
